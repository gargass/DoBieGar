The\nmain goal is to find which biomarkers significantly impact on patient\nsurvival in different types of cancers.\n\n\\subsection{Data}\\label{data}\n\nAll of the used sets for the following cancers comes from RTCGA\nrepository:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item\n  GBMLGG - GBM + LGG (Glioblastoma multiforme and Lower Grade Glioma),\n\\item\n  BRCA - Breast invasive carcinoma\n\\item\n  KIPAN - Pan-kidney cohort\n\\item\n  COADREAD - Colorectal adenocarcinoma\n\\item\n  STES - Stomach and Esophageal carcinoma\n\\item\n  GBM - Glioblastoma multiforme\n\\item\n  OV - Ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma\n\\item\n  UCEC - Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma\n\\item\n  KIRC - Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma\n\\item\n  HNSC - Head-Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma\n\\item\n  LUAD - Lung adenocarcinoma\n\\item\n  LGG - Lower Grade Glioma\n\\item\n  LUSC - Lung squamous cell carcinoma\n\\item\n  THCA - Thyroid carcinoma\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe cancers from list corresponds to sets containing informations about at\nleast 500 patients. For each cancer we choose genes on which mutation\nhas occurred in at least 5\\% cases and then we find genes which have\nsignificant impact on patients survival. This significance was measured\nby p-value of log-rank test comparing survival time in two groups of\npatients divided by the presence of the mutation. The final list of\nbiomarkers is the union of significant genes for each type of cancer. In\nour application we consider 535 different genes.\n\nTo analyze the impact of the gene mutation on survival time, we have\nchosen two features:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item\n  presence of mutation - we divided patients in two groups: The first\n  one refers to patients without the gene mutation. The second one\n  refers to patients with at least one mutation on gene.\n\\item\n  type of mutation - we used variable Variant Classification, in which\n  mutations are classified into 10 different types:\n  Missense\\(\\_\\)Mutation, Silent, Frame\\(\\_\\)Shift\\(\\_\\)Del,\n  Frame\\(\\_\\)Shift\\(\\_\\)Ins, In\\(\\_\\)Frame\\(\\_\\)Del,\n  Nonsense\\(\\_\\)Mutation, RNA, Splice\\(\\_\\)Site, In\\(\\_\\)Frame\\(\\_\\)Ins,\n  Nonstop\\(\\_\\)Mutation.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Summary of gene mutation}\\label{summary-of-gene-mutation}\n\nThe table contains informations about the frequency and number of\npatients with the mutation of the selected gene among patients suffering\nfrom different types of cancers. It also includes information about the\nsignificance of mutations to patients survival. It is measured by the\np-value of the log-rank test, which allow to compare the survival time\nof two samples: in our case that samples are patients with the mutation\nof the selected gene and patients without this mutation. The null\nhypothesis is that the two groups have the same distribution of\nsurvival time. If the p-value is less than 0.05 then we have grounds to\nreject the null hypothesis at given significance level and the selected\ngene can be considered as a prognostic biomarker.\n\n\\subsection{Survival curves: Presence of\nmutation}\\label{survival-curves-presence-of-mutation}\n\nThis tab displays Kaplan-Meier curves for the given gene and the given\ncancers. The survival curves are estimated for the two groups of\npatients: the first one refers to the patients with a mutation of the\ngiven gene and the second one refers to the group of patients without\nany mutation of this gene. The Kaplan-Meier method estimates the\nprobability of survival at least until specified on the X axis time.\nMarks mean censored observations. The figures also show the p-value of\nthe log-rank test, which is helpful when we want to find out if two\nsurvival curves can be considered as different. Genes mutations are rare\nevents, so estimates are often based on only a few cases - it is worth\nto keep it in mind.\n\n\\subsection{Co-occurring genes}\\label{co-occurring-genes}\n\nThe table presents informations about co-occurrence mutations. For the\nselected gene and selected cancers a list of all considered biomarkers\nis given with information about how often patients who have had a\nmutation in a given gene have also mutation on listed genes. In\naddition, we show number of patients suffering on specific types of\ncancers with mutations on both genes.\n\n\\subsection{Survival curves: Variant\nClassification}\\label{survival-curves-variant-classification}\n\nThis tab also displays Kaplan-Meier curves for the given gene and the\ngiven cancers for two classification variants - presence of missense\nmutation and presence of nonsense mutation. Similar to tab `Survival\ncurves: Presence of mutation', the figures show the p-value of the\nlog-rank test, which examines the significance of a particular type of\nmutation.\n\n\\subsection{Frequency of mutation\ntypes}\\label{frequency-of-mutation-types}\n\nThe table contains informations about the occurrence frequency of\ndifferent types of mutations for a selected gene and selected cancers.\nAs you can see in majority of cancers the most frequent types of\nmutation are Missense Mutation and Nonsense Mutation. Groups with\nanother types of mutations offten are to small, so testing the\nsignificance of a particular type of mutation is not justified. In\naddition, we again show the level of occurrence of mutations in a given\ngene.\n\n\\citep{R}\n\n\\bibliography{RJreferences}\n\n\\address{%\nMarlena Bielat, \\href{bielat.marlena@gmail.com}{\\nolinkurl{bielat.marlena@gmail.com}}\\\\\nMałgorzata Dobkowska, \\href{gosia.dobkowska@tlen.pl}{\\nolinkurl{gosia.dobkowska@tlen.pl}} \\\\\nSebastian Gargas, \\href{gargass@student.mini.pw.edu.pl}{\\nolinkurl{gargass@student.mini.pw.edu.pl}}\\\\\nMiNI Warsaw University of Technology\\\\\n\\\\\n}\n\n\n\n",
